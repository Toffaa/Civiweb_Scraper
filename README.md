# Civiweb_Scraper
 
This project is composed of a web scraper base on *scrapy* to get the information on the offers of VIE/VIA available on https://www.civiweb.com/, and a *jupyter* notebook to analyse the gathered data.

The goal of this project was complete a full data project, from the data engineering part to the analysis. Also, I wanted to learn and use *scrapy* on a concrete case.

Even if all the data gathered by the scraper are public, I prefer not publishing them on the GitHub as I donâ€™t have legal knowledge on web scraping. However, the analysis is available on the notebook.
