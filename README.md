# Civiweb_Scraper
 
This project is composed of a web scraper base on *scrapy* to get the information on the offers of VIE/VIA available on https://www.civiweb.com/, and a *jupyter* notebook to analyse the gathered data.

The goal of this project was to complete a entire data project, from the data engineering part to the analysis. Also, I wanted to learn and use *scrapy* on a concrete case.

Even if all the data gathered by the scraper are public, I prefer not publishing them on the GitHub as I donâ€™t have legal knowledge on web scraping. However, the analysis is available on the notebook. If you'd like to read it on GitHub, be sure to select the static version, as GitHub does not allow to display dynamic graphs :
